## Web development

A typical Nasdanika Foundation Server CDO Web Application consists of multiple cross-referencing Single-Page Applications generated by [[routeOperations.md|route operations]] of model objects residing in a CDO repository, and leveraging other route operations, [[javascriptApi.md|JavaScript API]] and [[forms.md|form operations]]. 

For example, a simple banking application could be structured as follows:

* ``Guest`` object, used as an unathenticated principal would have a ``Home route`` rendering the landing page with a login form rendered from a ``login`` operation metadata and annotations, and invoking the ``login`` operation on submit through the JavaScript API. 
* On successful login the browser would navigate to the ``Customer`` home page displaying a summary of customer accounts.
* A click on account would navigate to the ``Account`` home page, which may allow to dynamically select statement transactions to browse. This functionality would use, say [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) bindings to the JavaScript object model to retrieve a list of transactions for a particular statement.  
       
       
### Choosing between KnockoutJS and AngularJS

[[bundle>org.nasdanika.web/doc/html.md|HTML API]] and form generators provide support for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and KnockoutJS. Whether to use one or the other depends on the way a particular single-page application communicates with the server side. 

If communication is performed through [[javascriptApi.md|JavaScript API]], then KnockoutJS is a better choice because the JavaScript API is asynchronous and leverages promises. Asynchronous communication may interfere with AngularJS' digest cycle if not coded correctly. Also, in this case only a tiny part of AngularJS functionality will be leveraged. One more thing to note is that KnockoutJS is better at reporting binding problems, so troubleshooting can be a bit easier.

In the case of use of operation routes which produce/consume JSON, AngularJS and its ``$http`` service can be a better choice. 

Choice between JavaScript API and route operations depends on the following factors:

* Can the domain model act as a view model? If the view model is very different from the domain model, then it is better to use route operations producing the view model.
* Progress notifications. The JavaScript API provides support for progress notifications for long-running operations. If this functionality is important, then JavaScript API shall be used. If the view model is different from the domain model, then view-model producing operations can be invoked through the JavaScript API.
