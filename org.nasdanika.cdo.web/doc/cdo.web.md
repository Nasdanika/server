## Web development

A typical Nasdanika Foundation Server CDO Web Application consists of multiple cross-referencing Single-Page Applications generated by [[routeOperations.md|route operations]] of model objects residing in a CDO repository, and leveraging [[javascriptApi.md|JavaScript API]] and [[forms.md|form operations]]. 

For example, a simple banking application could be structured as follows:

* ``Guest`` object, used as an unathenticated principal would have a ``Home route`` rendering the landing page with a login form rendered from a ``login`` operation metadata and annotations, and invoking the ``login`` operation on submit through the JavaScript API. 
* On successful login the browser would navigate to the ``Customer`` home page displaying a summary of customer accounts.
* A click on account would navigate to the ``Account`` home page, which may allow to dynamically select statement transactions to browse. This functionality would use, say [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) bindings to the JavaScript object model to retrieve a list of transactions for a particular statement.
